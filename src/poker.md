projectInfo: [
    'This application uses real-time data to create a multi-user poker game. You can make or join a room to play against other people',
    'The point of creating this game was to learn and experiment with webSockets and creating a multi-user experience.',
    'I didnâ€™t have time to add betting to the game. So you can either check or fold. As a poker game it is not complete, but my goal of getting a better understanding of webSockets and handling multi-user data was reached.'
