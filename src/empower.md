projectInfo: [
    'The focus of the application is helping prosumers in their effort to make a green energy community. Our goal is to to create inspirational examples of features for the digital platform EMPOWER 2.0 by exploring visualization possibilities using data from Dutch open sources and combining three different types of information: the number of initiatives in a place and its characteristics, the renewable energy production of different areas in the Netherlands and, mainly, the capacity of production of each area.',
    'During this project I've worked with 3 designers. I was the sole developer. I focussed on gathering and transforming data and making an interactive data visualisation. During the process I also thought along with the designers.'
